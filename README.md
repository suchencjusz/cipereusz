This project is a fully transparent, open-source implementation inspired by GenAI-Bot. 
Unlike the original, which functions as a 'black box' by processing your data on unknown external servers, this version is 100% self-hosted.
This 'spyware-like' behavior is eliminated by running the bot entirely on your own machine, ensuring your server's conversations and data remain completely private.
